I am a Full-Stack Web Developer adept in MERN Stack

Self-motivated and hardworking graduate looking for an
opportunity to work in a challenging environment to
enhance my skills and utilize my knowledge for the growth
of the organization.

I remember the first time I used basic programming in school and wrote simple programs. It was exciting to see your sentences come alive on the website. I then began learning C++ and JAVA. The process of solving problems in C++ and Java ignited a spark in my head and made me contemplate it as a career. My curiosity grew and I wanted to know how software and applications worked. And so I decided to pursue B.Tech. Unfortunately, I could not get into Computer Science and ended up joining Mechanical Engineering.
After my graduation, while working in the automobile industry I realized I want to get into Information Technology. I then enrolled at Masai School for a course on Full Stack Development and currently aspiring to be a Full Stack Web Developer.

I am a quick learner and have good problem-solving skills. I am also interested in Design Thinking. I am adept in Java, HTML, CSS, Javascript, C++, ReactJS, MongoDB, NodeJS, REST APIs, and Git/Github.

Apart from web development, I am interested in traveling, driving, sketching, and Formula 1.
