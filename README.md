I am a certified software engineer with expertise in C#, .NET, React, TypeScript, eCharts, data visualization, ETL tools, and DevOps. My journey into programming began with learning basic programming in school, which sparked my interest in software development. Despite initially pursuing a degree in Mechanical Engineering, my passion for IT led me to enroll in a Full Stack Development course at Masai School.

Currently, I am working as a Full Stack Web Developer at Noesys Software, where I am building FuseData, a data automation and data engineering product. I have strong problem-solving skills and a keen interest in Design Thinking. My technical proficiency includes ReactJS, .NET, Java, CSS, JavaScript, C++, MongoDB, NodeJS, REST APIs, and Git/Github.

Apart from web development, I enjoy traveling, driving, sketching, and following Formula 1.
